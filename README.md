**Calculator App**

This is a simple, responsive calculator app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator provides basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It features a user-friendly design and real-time calculation functionality.

**Features**

1.Basic Operations: Perform addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).

2.Real-time Input Display: Displays the numbers and operators entered.

3.Clear Functionality: A button to clear the entire input.

4.Error Handling: Alerts the user if an invalid mathematical expression is entered.

5.Responsive Design: Adapts to different screen sizes.


**Technology Stack**

HTML: For the structure of the app.

CSS: For styling, including layout, hover effects, and responsive design.

JavaScript: For the app's interactive functionalities such as input handling, calculations, and error validation.


**How It Works**

1.Input Handling:

Numbers and operators are appended to the display field when clicked.
JavaScript handles the input through the appendValue() function.

2.Calculation:

Clicking the = button triggers the calculate() function, which evaluates the mathematical expression using eval().
If the expression is invalid, an alert notifies the user.

3.Clear Display:

The "Clear" button calls the clearDisplay() function to reset the input.
